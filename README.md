# Create an application that queries two APIs (GitHub & StackOverflow) and generates an SQL database.  That database is then used to populate a created GUI that maps the location of jobs and presents pop-ups giving data on those jobs.

# Working Functions:

- Created Map
- Created the filter table
- Created the location cache table
- Merge tables to plot on map


# Not Working: 
- No UI for setting tags to filter against
- Have to manually change location to filter for in code
- No tags being displayed in GUI
