In our experience, they’re a terrible representation of what a job really entails and never paint a true picture of what it’s like to work at an organization.</p>\n<p>That’s why, at Fundera, we do things differently. Instead of presenting you with some run-of-the-mill job description, we offer potential candidates our Job Spotlights. This gives us a chance to tell you the story of us, why you should work here, and what the role is really like.</p>\n<p>Who’s Fundera and Why Should I Care?</p>\n<p>Fundera is the go-to financial resource for small businesses. We’re here to help entrepreneurs achieve their financial goals and grow businesses as big as their aspirations.</p>\n<p>As a catalyst for smart financial decisions, our combination of proprietary technology and financial expertise provides business owners with tailored solutions based on their unique needs and eligibility—helping them prosper, create more jobs, and, ultimately, grow the economy.</p>\n<p>Armed with one of the most experienced and passionate leadership teams in the business and backed by the industry’s leading investors, we’ve made a big impact on Main Street in just a short amount of time (Fundera launched in 2014 and has helped 35,000+ small businesses find their best financial solutions and secure over $1 billion in funding).</p>\n<p>We’re experiencing massive growth year over year, and our impact on America’s job creators grows with us.

Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.</p>\n<p>For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.</li>\n<li>We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)</li>\n<li>Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.</li>\n<li>Everybody needs a little R&amp;R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.</li>\n<li>We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators.

Wij zijn Multidisciplinair Team Integration Services, onderdeel van FB-IT, en verantwoordelijk voor het beheer en onderhoud van het integratie systeemlandschap van Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR). FB-IT is het IT-schakelpunt voor WUR en heeft een constant veranderend applicatielandschap waarbij diensten en technieken in beweging zijn én blijven. Beheer, integratie en ontwikkeling gebeuren allemaal in-house.\nHet integratielandschap bestaat op dit moment uit twee oplossingen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) gebaseerd op Openshift/Docker, Apache Camel, Splunk en Gitlab. Het platform is op basis van Java-code gebouwd.</li>\n<li>Oud ESB-platform op basis van WSO2 dat wordt uitgefaseerd door het bovengenoemde platform.\nOnze primaire taak bestaat uit het in de lucht houden van onze flexibele, robuuste en betrouwbare oplossing voor integratie voor de WUR.

Door het bewegende landschap en technieken verandert de rol van FB-IT voortdurend, en jij verandert mee.\nWe zoeken een devops engineer, een persoon met een groot bewustzijn op het gebied van stabiliteit, kwaliteit en procesbewaking die ons ondersteunt bij het beheer van het platform. Het beheer is door steeds verdergaande automatisering en strakke bewaking van conventies steeds minder een fulltime bezigheid.

But we’re not stopping there, and our engineers are at the forefront of taking us forward to meet the demands of even greater scale.</p>\n<p>From our monolithic datacenter beginnings we’ve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We’re currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes and Jenkins-X as we further embrace a microservices architecture.</p>\n<p>As a Senior Software Engineer you’ll play a key role within your team; taking responsibility for your services and the technology within them, but also in helping develop your team and its relationship with your product owner and the broader business.

We also have specialist applications written in a functional style using Scala and Elixir.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SQL, and large SQL databases</strong>, provide the persistence layer for our applications. You’ll be working with (and know the limitations of using) such large datastores.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Infrastructure automation</strong> is primarily owned by the infrastructure team and you will play a key part in the SDKs that we maintain.  You’ll also have good knowledge in Enterprise Integration Systems</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing approaches, including TDD, BDD and Contract Testing</strong>, all form an important part of our approach to quality assurance; ensuring that the code that we write forms products that are fit for use. We currently use RSpec and Cucumber.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Agile development</strong>, with teams broadly aligned with the Spotify - Squads &amp; Tribes - model, helps us deliver incremental improvements to our products in an iterative manner. Advocating this model, and joining us on a journey of continuous improvement, is a key attribute of senior members of our teams.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines</strong> allow us to “automate all the things”, providing repeatable builds and consistent deployments.\nGitHub, and the GitHub PR review process, forms a core part of our developer workflow, and peer reviews help share knowledge and improve quality.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Teamwork, and cross-team collaboration</strong>, is fundamental to the delivery of our applications. Whilst each application has an independent path to production, there will always be some activities and initiatives that span multiple teams and require cross-team collaboration. Within your team you’ll need to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, including Product Owners and QA, as part of your product development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these on their own are a must-have to apply for the role, but it would be useful to share with us any knowledge or experience that you have in these areas.

Whilst your colleagues may be on the lookout for blockchain, robotics or machine learning innovations, you focus specifically on Internet of Things.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the role</strong></p>\n<p>Recognizing new IoT opportunities is an important part of the role, but equally important is the actual development, delivery and deployment of IoT and related technologies and solutions (such as Edge, 4G/5G/LTE, Sensors, Track &amp; Trace, etc.).

Binnen S&amp;I is de afdeling Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) verantwoordelijk voor alle ICT Systemen die Luchtverkeersleiders gebruiken om hun dagelijkse werk te kunnen doen en voor de simulatoren die gebruikt worden om Luchtverkeersleiders te trainen.</p>\n<p>De afdeling ATMS is in vier teams onderverdeeld, elk met zijn eigen focusgebied: Torensystemen (TWR), Radarverkeersleiding systemen (AAA en iCAS) en Informatiesystemen (IS). De teams bestaan allen uit ca. 15 tot 20 vaste medewerkers, aangevuld door inhuurkrachten. Samen zorgen zij voor een circa 35 systemen, deels ingekocht bij leveranciers en deels zelf ontwikkeld.</p>\n<p>Je kunt aan de slag binnen het team Tower of het team Information Systems.

Binnen het team Information Systems zal je onder andere werken aan het Control Center Circuit Information System v2 (CCISv2). Dat systeem biedt luchtverkeersleiders informatie over onder andere meteo, de baanplanning, de luchthaven en de systeemstatus van bijvoorbeeld de automatisch landingssystemen.</p>\n<p>Alle systemen die gebruikt worden voor Luchtverkeersleiding dienen uiterst solide en consistent te zijn. Software ontwikkeling doen wij in sprints en op basis van Agile/scrum. De software wordt m.b.v. een release opgeleverd op een aantal omgevingen. Testautomatisering is doorgevoerd om efficiënter een kwalitatief acceptabel product te leveren. De releases worden gerealiseerd op basis van voorschriften in een software assurance system. De externe toezichthouder voert regelmatig een audit uit op het voldoen aan deze voorschriften.</p>\n<p>Naast het ontwikkelen van software zal je als Software Developer ook gevraagd worden voor het oplossen van storingen (3e lijn onderhoud), bijhouden van (opleidings-)documentatie en onderhoudsprocedures en ben je een aanspreekpunt voor de mensen die het 1e en 2e lijn onderhoud aan de systemen uitvoeren.</p>\n<p><strong>Ontwikkelingen</strong></p>\n<p>In de komende 3-5 jaar vinden er belangrijke veranderingen plaats rond enkele systemen. Zo zullen het Torensysteem en het Radarverkeersleidingsysteem AAA, die wij beide zelf in beheer hebben, volledig vervangen worden door aangekochte systemen (TWR2020 en iCAS).

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there\'s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we\'ve created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</p>\n<p>We don’t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you\'ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p>\n<p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>You don\'t have to worry about the company running out of money.</p>\n<p>8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p>\n<p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</p>\n<p>Here’s What We Expect From You…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re excellent at PHP</li>\n<li>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li>\n<li>You\'ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li>\n<li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li>\n<li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li>\n<li>You have an excellent attention to detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.</p>\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion.

Graph theory and routing algorithms are well known to you. Also, vehicle routing problems (VRP) are no strangers to you or at least something you always wanted to learn more about and master. You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing.

We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we’re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to\njoin us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel’s rapidly expanding mobility platform.</p>\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 250 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.</p>\n<p>With us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools\nof their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.</p>\n<p>Breaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend</li>\n<li>You build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores</li>\n<li>You develop services using Node.js &amp; Python</li>\n<li>You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions</li>\n<li>You write processing pipelines in Python</li>\n<li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT YOU\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.</p>\n<p>You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. </p>\n<p>As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.</p>\n<p>BENEFITS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your own hardware</li>\n<li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices</li>\n<li>Company pension plan</li>\n<li>Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water</li>\n<li>Mobility allowance</li>\n<li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts</li>\n<li>Working on products with a high impact on society</li>\n<li>International teams</li>\n<li>Child care allowance</li>\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds good?\nWe are more than happy to meet you soon!

Well, although Datawrapper is used primarily by journalists, our customer base is growing and diversifying, and some of our users come with special requirements and challenges. We want to be able to accommodate these people as well. Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n<h3>The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you\'re responsible for.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS’s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers\' teams don’t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we’re looking for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, <strong>preferrably full-time</strong>, but open to flexible work time arrangements.</li>\n<li>You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will <strong>not be possible to do this job entirely remote</strong>. <em>Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.</em>\n</li>\n<li>On the technical side, most of the work we’re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href="https://svelte.technology/">Svelte</a></strong>. There’s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won’t be too much of your concern.</li>\n<li>We’re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don\'t need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We’re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What the "client-facing" part entails:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A significant part of the job will involve <strong>interacting with users and customers.</strong> be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent</li>\n<li>That means we\'re looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\n<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\n<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We\'d love to take a look at it. Even if you don’t, please don’t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we can offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg</strong>, where seven of us work (<a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/about-us/">Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David</a>). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We\'re looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There\'s no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We\'re all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don\'t care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don\'t find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway.

We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’ll be in great company.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients’ development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times.

You will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain’s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>\n<li>Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>\n<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>You’ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I’ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it’s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a ‘teach a team to fish’ mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC’s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams.

In our experience, they’re a terrible representation of what a job really entails and never paint a true picture of what it’s like to work at an organization.</p>\n<p>That’s why, at Fundera, we do things differently. Instead of presenting you with some run-of-the-mill job description, we offer potential candidates our Job Spotlights. This gives us a chance to tell you the story of us, why you should work here, and what the role is really like.</p>\n<p>Who’s Fundera and Why Should I Care?</p>\n<p>Fundera is the go-to financial resource for small businesses. We’re here to help entrepreneurs achieve their financial goals and grow businesses as big as their aspirations.</p>\n<p>As a catalyst for smart financial decisions, our combination of proprietary technology and financial expertise provides business owners with tailored solutions based on their unique needs and eligibility—helping them prosper, create more jobs, and, ultimately, grow the economy.</p>\n<p>Armed with one of the most experienced and passionate leadership teams in the business and backed by the industry’s leading investors, we’ve made a big impact on Main Street in just a short amount of time (Fundera launched in 2014 and has helped 35,000+ small businesses find their best financial solutions and secure over $1 billion in funding).</p>\n<p>We’re experiencing massive growth year over year, and our impact on America’s job creators grows with us.

Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.</p>\n<p>For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.</li>\n<li>We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)</li>\n<li>Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.</li>\n<li>Everybody needs a little R&amp;R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.</li>\n<li>We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators.

Making a real difference to the way we do business, whilst getting every opportunity to develop your career.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Where you fit</strong></p>\n<p>Our world becomes ever more digital and connected and Shell’s global assets are no exception to the case. The amount of data that Shell is collecting globally is huge and we have therefore set up a dedicated team working on extracting useful information from the data to help business decisions.</p>\n<p>As our Internet of Things (IoT) Consultant you will become part of the Emerging Technologies team that sits in our Digital Center of Excellence in Amsterdam. Together with your colleagues you constantly keep an eye on the external market to spot the latest digital developments that can be deployed to deliver value to any of the Shell businesses. Whilst your colleagues may be on the lookout for blockchain, robotics or machine learning innovations, you focus specifically on Internet of Things.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the role</strong></p>\n<p>Recognizing new IoT opportunities is an important part of the role, but equally important is the actual development, delivery and deployment of IoT and related technologies and solutions (such as Edge, 4G/5G/LTE, Sensors, Track &amp; Trace, etc.). You will do so in an agile fashion in order to provide new insights, drive improvements to business processes and solve business problems.</p>\n<p>Working within a fast-paced environment, you’ll exercise a real hands-on technical approach as you advise our business stakeholders and take the lead on a wide range of duties, from device selection, development and configuration, to integration across systems and cloud environments.</p>\n<p>More specific responsibilities will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and develop proofs-of-technology, prototypes, and implement using IoT hardware, platforms, and multiple communication protocols.</li>\n<li>Building constructive and trusting relationships with (remote) business stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Dealing with challenges in data acquisition from different parts of the business</li>\n<li>Working with start-ups and vendors to develop an understanding of state-of-the-art IoT technologies and to evaluate and benchmark IoT platforms and tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What we need from you</strong></p>\n<p>While you don’t have to be (or have been) an expert in IoT and related technologies, we do expect you can demonstrate the curiosity and drive to learn about these technologies in a short period of time. In addition, you have contextual analytical skills to identify opportunities for IoT in Shell’s businesses, both at the technical (end-to-end integration) and business level (economics, work-processes). Having experience with technical development in a cloud environment, as well as a degree (Master or PhD) in Computer Science or related areas, will be a strong feature to work with suppliers &amp; start-up companies.</p>\n<p>Finally, we hope to see as many of the following on your CV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creative problem solver and team player with strong communication skills.</li>\n<li>Good oversight and being practical at the same time.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of IoT communication protocols.</li>\n<li>Practical experience with MS Azure and/or AWS PaaS cloud solutions, (Good) Knowledge of Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Company Description</strong></p>\n<p><strong>An innovative place to work</strong></p>\n<p>There’s never been a more exciting time to work at Shell.

We’ll encourage you to try new roles and experience new settings.

Fundamentals are being questioned, new ways of getting around are emerging and challenging the established ones. At moovel (becomes REACH NOW), we aim to take part in shaping that future. Software is eating the world and mobility is certainly no exception. Ultimately, we want to help cities become smarter by building on the operational wisdom of city administrations and mobility service providers. We don\'t want to disrupt, but augment the means of getting around by employing contemporary technology.</p>\n<p>The problems we are engaging are manifold and from the real world. Our solutions do not only have an impact on a single industry branch, but also aim to transform the city. They involve fields like routing, searching, AI, innovative UX and much more. Things are very dynamic in the mobility space and thus we devote ourselves to a lot of exploratory work.</p>\n<h2>How the role works</h2>\n<p>We gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. Individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility, where innovation is very much encouraged and embraced. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.</p>\n<p>With us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel (becomes REACH NOW) tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>Squads at moovel (becomes REACH NOW) choose the tools that fit their problems best, at their discretion.

De teams bestaan allen uit ca. 15 tot 20 vaste medewerkers, aangevuld door inhuurkrachten. Samen zorgen zij voor een circa 35 systemen, deels ingekocht bij leveranciers en deels zelf ontwikkeld.</p>\n<p>Je kunt aan de slag binnen het team Tower of het team Information Systems.

Binnen het team Information Systems zal je onder andere werken aan het Control Center Circuit Information System v2 (CCISv2). Dat systeem biedt luchtverkeersleiders informatie over onder andere meteo, de baanplanning, de luchthaven en de systeemstatus van bijvoorbeeld de automatisch landingssystemen.</p>\n<p>Alle systemen die gebruikt worden voor Luchtverkeersleiding dienen uiterst solide en consistent te zijn. Software ontwikkeling doen wij in sprints en op basis van Agile/scrum. De software wordt m.b.v. een release opgeleverd op een aantal omgevingen. Testautomatisering is doorgevoerd om efficiënter een kwalitatief acceptabel product te leveren. De releases worden gerealiseerd op basis van voorschriften in een software assurance system. De externe toezichthouder voert regelmatig een audit uit op het voldoen aan deze voorschriften.</p>\n<p>Naast het ontwikkelen van software zal je als Software Developer ook gevraagd worden voor het oplossen van storingen (3e lijn onderhoud), bijhouden van (opleidings-)documentatie en onderhoudsprocedures en ben je een aanspreekpunt voor de mensen die het 1e en 2e lijn onderhoud aan de systemen uitvoeren.</p>\n<p><strong>Ontwikkelingen</strong></p>\n<p>In de komende 3-5 jaar vinden er belangrijke veranderingen plaats rond enkele systemen. Zo zullen het Torensysteem en het Radarverkeersleidingsysteem AAA, die wij beide zelf in beheer hebben, volledig vervangen worden door aangekochte systemen (TWR2020 en iCAS). Daarnaast is er voor de verdere doorontwikkeling van CCISv2 in 2018 door LVNL een samenwerkingstraject gestart met de Duitse luchtverkeersleiding (DFS). Dit betekent dat ook functionele veranderingen ten behoeve van de DFS in CCISv2 gerealiseerd worden. Deze veranderingen betekenen dat het ontwikkelwerk van de Software Developers zich in de toekomst meer zal richten op de simulatoren en dataverwerkingssystemen en dat er meer configuratie en adaptatie werk voor de ingekochte systemen gedaan zal worden.</p>\n<p><strong>Wie ben jij?</strong></p>\n<p>Veiligheid is onze hoogste prioriteit en vakkundigheid staat voorop.

Het CBS levert als hét statistische bureau van Nederland met betrouwbare statistische informatie en data inzicht in maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Daarmee voedt het CBS het maatschappelijk debat, de beleidsontwikkeling en de besluitvorming en draagt zo bij aan welvaart, welzijn en democratie.</p>\n<p>Het CBS werd in 1899 opgericht vanuit de behoefte aan onafhankelijke, betrouwbare informatie om maatschappelijke vraagstukken te begrijpen. Deze rol heeft het CBS nog altijd. De organisatie is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een innovatieve kennisorganisatie, die voortdurend nieuwe technologieën en ontwikkelingen toepast om de kwaliteit van de gegevens en de onafhankelijke positie te kunnen blijven borgen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wat ga je doen?</strong></h2>\n<p>Je werkt aan het ambitieuze innovatieve product Information Dialogue dat alle statistische informatie van het CBS via toepassing van AI ontsluit, zodat een gebruiker precies díe informatie krijgt die hij nodig heeft. Dit doen we door een computergestuurde dialoog, zo menselijk mogelijk, te ontwikkelen die alle informatie die nu in onze open data database beschikbaar is aan te bieden. We zijn het eerste statistiekbureau in de wereld dat deze uitdaging aangaat.\nJe gaat de software ontwikkelen die de verbinding maakt tussen deze open data en de spraakrobot (bijvoorbeeld Google Assistant).\nVoor een impressie waaraan je gaat werken klik hier</p>\n<h2><strong>Wie zoeken wij</strong></h2>\n<p>Je bent een Software Engineer met kennis van C#, node.js en Xamarin waarbij kennis van AI-bots zoals Google Dialogflow (Assistent), Cortana, Alexa of Siri een pré is.

Daarnaast ben je bekend met de principes van Agile en Scrum. Uiteraard heb je uitstekende samenwerkingsvaardigheden.</p>\n<h2><strong>Waar kom je te werken</strong></h2>\n<p>Je komt te werken in een jong agile team dat verantwoordelijk is voor ontwikkeling van de Information Dialogue, één van de cutting edge innovaties die er voor zorgen dat het CBS tot één van de beste en meest vooruitstrevende statistiekbureaus ter wereld blijft behoren.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there\'s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we\'ve created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</p>\n<p>We don’t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you\'ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p>\n<p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>You don\'t have to worry about the company running out of money.</p>\n<p>8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p>\n<p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</p>\n<p>Here’s What We Expect From You…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re excellent at PHP</li>\n<li>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li>\n<li>You\'ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li>\n<li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li>\n<li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li>\n<li>You have an excellent attention to detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n<h3>The kind of stuff you’ll be doing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups.

Every day for every Strider is different. Here’s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I’m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager’s take. We walk away with action items for next week’s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I’m at work at the client’s office. They’ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I’m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I’m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride’s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I’m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client’s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we’re retrospecting our last release. I’ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy.
